# SBA-308-2-JS-KB
This is my attempt at greatness... everyone's gotta start somewhere, okay?
This is being submitted for the SBA 308: JavaScript Fundamentals assignment. It's [supposed to be] able to average scores and actual assignment scores, also accounting for late submissions.
May the odds be ever in my favor.
